					<p>During the assignment the choices I made were influenced majorly by what I wanted to learn, be it, how to create a bypass allowing me to do dynamic things on a static website. I based the choices off of things that I felt would help the overall dynamic of the website</p>

				<h1 style="padding: 16px; margin: 0;">Jack's Reflection</h1>
				<div style="margin: 8px; padding: 8px; background-color: #2e2e2e; border-radius: 8px;">
					<p>During the creation of Leroy and my website, I learned how to collaborate on a major project, briefly optimize websites, and how important the use of planning is. The planning of our website was a bit delayed; we began to design the website before we sat down and planned the website out, this ultimately led to the problem of needing to recreate the entire home page because I wasn’t happy with it. This created time delays and taught me that planning is always necessary even when I think I know what I want.</p>
					<p>The design phase happened in 2 parts, the first part being a kind of testing phase, we created a base website with pretty bad layout but overall paved the way for our current dual color and layout shifts to conform to the user's wants and the device's size. The content was influenced by both Mr. Robinson’s and Mrs. Daly’s ideas, this feedback led to a well-polished website pushing us to make it better and better. As for the photos, they were all taken by me and used on our website to create a visually intriguing and engaging experience.</p>
					<p>The largest technical challenges I faced were getting the light/dark mode switch to work and save the user's preference so they didn’t have to change it each time they opened a different page. Another issue that kept appearing was that our hosting service (GitHub) only allowed static webpages and I wanted things like a contact page, which usually uses a type of code called PHP, a server-side coding language. However, due to the website's static format, PHP was not compatible with our website. To bypass this issue, I found a service called Unstatic, which allowed static webpages like mine to bypass these restrictions by sending the data to their servers, which would then email the responses to my email.</p>
					<p>Throughout the development of the website, a constant goal for us was optimizing our website so that any user would have a good, well-polished experience. This led to tedious testing of the website. During our testing, I found a feature within modern chromium-based browsers called Device Toolbar; this allowed us to test a range of sizes without needing devices of that size. It also showed that our images were too large for most devices, causing long loading times and website instability.</p>
					<p>This task has taught me a lot about teamwork, design choices, and a lot about planning websites. Planning was the first thing we should have worked on, rather than just winging the design; this was my biggest regret, and if I were to ever do something like this again, I would begin with the design. Overall, this was a great experience and one of my favorite assignments; it has taught me a lot and made me think greatly about my choices when it came to creating it.</p>

				<div style="margin: 8px; padding: 8px; background-color: #2e2e2e; border-radius: 8px;">
					<p>We made a marketing website designed to sell photos. Our goals were to create a visually pleasing and easy-to-navigate website. One of the features I implemented was the ability to switch between light and dark mode. This way, users can choose their preferred mode, and the website remembers their preference for future visits. We believed this capability would enhance the overall user experience since some people prefer light mode while others prefer dark mode, including both Jack and me. 
					</p>
					<p>Additionally, I focused on optimizing the mobile experience. It was crucial for the website to work seamlessly on mobile devices, not just on computers.  
					</p>
					<p>Although some of the images are high-resolution to provide a visually appealing experience when expanded, it can cause slight lag during the webpage's initial loading as the images load progressively. Another limitation of the webpage is the gallery on the home page, which has a side-scrolling bar. To navigate through the gallery, users need to hold the 'shift' key while scrolling left or right to view the other images. 
					</p>
					<p>Throughout the development process, we made decisions that aimed to improve optimization and accessibility for a variety of viewers. These choices have contributed to making our website more user-friendly and accommodating to different preferences and devices.</p>

						Over the time building the website, I have gained several skills, such as the ability to code in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website I helped design and produce was made as a marketing website to try and sell products. We have a gallery of a few photos and an area for you to see photos (they are currently placeholders) and potentially purchase them.
					</p>
					<p>
						We didn’t only focus on the marketing side of the website, but we also dived into some other side objectives. These include remembering if you were in light or dark mode, a contact page that sends us emails, a mobile version of all the pages designed to look nice on mobile, and finally, a login feature that we haven't quite gotten working yet.
					</p>
					<p>
						We had several design stages when building the website (some of which are visible on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230000000000*/https://jsoproductions.github.io" target="_blank">archive.org</a>), but we have settled on our current design as it is easier to navigate and looks less clunky. The project helped me to work collaboratively and get ideas from others. It also taught me how to work around issues and problem solve, as there were many since we were unable to utilize PHP.
					</p>
					<p>
						I personally believe the website has turned out looking good and providing the functions we desired. It was enjoyable to have a challenge, sometimes working for hours on one thing just to get nowhere, but in the end, we pushed through and got it working.

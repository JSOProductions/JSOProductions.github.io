					<p>We made a marketing website designed to sell photos. Our goals were to create a visually pleasing and easy-to-navigate website. One of the features I implemented was the ability to switch between light and dark mode. This way, users can choose their preferred mode, and the website remembers their preference for future visits. We believed this capability would enhance the overall user experience since some people prefer light mode while others prefer dark mode, including both Jack and me. 
					</p>
					<p>Additionally, I focused on optimizing the mobile experience. It was crucial for the website to work seamlessly on mobile devices, not just on computers.  
					</p>
					<p>Although some of the images are high-resolution to provide a visually appealing experience when expanded, it can cause slight lag during the webpage's initial loading as the images load progressively. Another limitation of the webpage is the gallery on the home page, which has a side-scrolling bar. To navigate through the gallery, users need to hold the 'shift' key while scrolling left or right to view the other images. 
					</p>
					<p>Throughout the development process, we made decisions that aimed to improve optimization and accessibility for a variety of viewers. These choices have contributed to making our website more user-friendly and accommodating to different preferences and devices.</p>

						Over the time building the website, I have gained several skills, such as the ability to code in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website I helped design and produce was made as a marketing website to try and sell products. We have a gallery of a few photos and an area for you to see photos (they are currently placeholders) and potentially purchase them.
					</p>
					<p>
						We didn’t only focus on the marketing side of the website, but we also dived into some other side objectives. These include remembering if you were in light or dark mode, a contact page that sends us emails, a mobile version of all the pages designed to look nice on mobile, and finally, a login feature that we haven't quite gotten working yet.
					</p>
					<p>
						We had several design stages when building the website (some of which are visible on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230000000000*/https://jsoproductions.github.io" target="_blank">archive.org</a>), but we have settled on our current design as it is easier to navigate and looks less clunky. The project helped me to work collaboratively and get ideas from others. It also taught me how to work around issues and problem solve, as there were many since we were unable to utilize PHP.
					</p>
					<p>
						I personally believe the website has turned out looking good and providing the functions we desired. It was enjoyable to have a challenge, sometimes working for hours on one thing just to get nowhere, but in the end, we pushed through and got it working.
